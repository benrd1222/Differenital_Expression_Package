# Differenital_Expression_Package
A first go at package creation in R. Mainly just a collection of useful little functions 
for streamlining RNASeq data and performing repeated analyses and visualization

The goal is to generate a collection of functions with easy names and understandable
arguments to reduce the R knowledge required to produce differential expression
analyses for my lab group. This mainly entails data wrangling and using some regular
expression syntax to make inputs friendly to someone has a rudimentary understanding
of coding in R.

It may end up that I am the only one using these tools, however why not generate
a framework for repeatable data manipulation for RNAseq data and learn a little
about package generation in R.

See the walkthrough.md for more details. Viewing on github should automatically
display the html, if you are looking at the files locally hit the knit button
located right under the files name in the editor.

Moved on to better repeatable workflow projects. This code was pretty terrible,
but I think it stands as a good testament to my growth.
